## Code Pre-Flight Checklist

### Steps

1. **Read session memo:**
   ```bash
   ls -t .session-memos/*.md | head -1
   ```
   Summarise in one sentence what this Code session is supposed to do.

2. **Check previous mistakes** — look for `## Mistakes Made` in memo:
   - Read each mistake aloud
   - State how you will avoid repeating each one
   - If none, state that clearly

3. **State exact scope:**
   - Which file will be changed
   - Which function or section will be changed
   - What specific change will be made
   - What will **NOT** be changed

4. **Read only what is needed** — relevant function only, not entire file.

5. **Show the plan** — exact proposed change in a code block with inline comments. Do not edit yet.

6. **Wait for OK** — ask:
   > "Does this plan look correct? Shall I proceed?"

   Do not touch any file until user says yes.
