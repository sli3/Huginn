## Session Memo Protocol

### Steps

1. **Determine session type** — if not stated, ask:
   > "What type was this session? (Explore / Plan / Code / Review / Mixed)"
   Wait for the answer before writing.

2. **Summarise** — Generate a concise session summary containing:
   - Session type (Explore / Plan / Code / Review)
   - What was discussed or decided (2–3 lines max)
   - What was changed or written (list files and functions touched)
   - What was NOT finished (next steps, max 3 bullet points)
   - Any important decisions or rejected approaches
   - Any mistakes made this session with their category

3. **Create memo directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .session-memos
   ```

4. **Write memo file** — get timestamp with bash:
   ```bash
   TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d_%H-%M")
   MEMO_FILE=".session-memos/${TIMESTAMP}.md"
   ```
   Never overwrite existing memos — always fresh timestamp.

5. **Memo format:**

```markdown
# Session Memo — [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM]

## Type
[Explore / Plan / Code / Review / Mixed]

## What We Did
- [2–3 concise bullet points]

## Functions Found *(Explore ONLY — MANDATORY)*
- `[function_name]`: [one line description]
- *(list every function — never group)*
- *(omit for non-Explore sessions)*

## Issues Found *(Explore ONLY — MANDATORY)*
- [exact issue] — Priority: High / Medium / Low
- *(list every issue — never omit or group)*
- *(omit for non-Explore sessions)*

## Agreed Next Step *(Explore ONLY — MANDATORY)*
[exactly what was decided to tackle next and why]
*(omit for non-Explore sessions)*

## Files Touched
- `[filename]`: [what changed]
- None *(if read-only session)*

## Decisions Made
- [approach chosen and why]
- [approach rejected and why]

## Mistakes Made
- [exact description] — Category: [Scope Creep / Safety Violation / Logic Error / Process Skip]
- None *(if no mistakes)*

## Not Finished
- [up to 3 clear next steps]

## Next Session Starter
[One specific actionable opening message for the next session]
```

6. **Confirm** — print file path only:
   ```
   Memo saved to .session-memos/[timestamp].md
   ```

### Rules

- Save to `.session-memos/` in project root only
- Never overwrite existing memos
- Keep summary under 300 words
- Next Session Starter must be specific and actionable
- Do **NOT** print full memo contents — just confirm file path
